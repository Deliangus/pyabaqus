# Plug-in registration commands

Plug-in commands register kernel and GUI plug-ins in either the Plug-ins menu or in a toolbox. Plug-in registration commands for accessing both kernel and GUI plug-ins are located in the [Abaqus GUI Toolkit Reference Guide](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEGUIRefHtml/simagui-c-ov.htm?ContextScope=all).
