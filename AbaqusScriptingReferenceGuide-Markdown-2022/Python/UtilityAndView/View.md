# View object

The [Session](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-sessionpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) and [Viewport](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-viewportpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) View objects store view settings for custom (both predefined and user-defined) views. The paradigm used to define a view is based on a camera analogy. Similar to taking a photograph with a camera, features such as camera position, view direction, orientation, depth of field, and projection are specified to transform three-dimensional views to the screen.

The [Layer](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-layerpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) View objects store a transformation matrix used to position the contents of the [Layer](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-layerpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) within a viewport.

## View(...)



This method creates a View object.

Note:All dimensions and coordinates are specified in the model coordinate system.

### Path

session.View

### Required arguments

- *name*

  A String specifying the name of the view (also used as the repository key). Possible values are 'Front', 'Back', 'Top', 'Bottom', 'Left', `Right', 'Iso', 'User-1', 'User-2', 'User-3', and 'User-4'. The object member associated with this argument is a SymbolicConstant. Possible values of the *name* member are:FRONT, BACK, TOP, BOTTOM, LEFT, RIGHT, ISO, USER1, USER2, USER3, and USER4.

- *nearPlane*

  A Float specifying the distance from the camera to the near clipping plane. Possible values are *nearPlane* >> 0.0.

- *farPlane*

  A Float specifying the distance from the camera to the far clipping plane when *farPlaneMode* =SPECIFY. Possible values are *farPlane* >> *nearPlane*.

- *width*

  A Float specifying the width of the front clipping plane. Possible values are *width* >> 0.0.

- *height*

  A Float specifying the height of the front clipping plane. Possible values are *height* >> 0.0.
