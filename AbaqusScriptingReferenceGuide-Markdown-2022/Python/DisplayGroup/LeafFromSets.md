# LeafFromSets object

The LeafFromSets object can be used whenever a [Leaf](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-leafpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) object is expected as an argument. [Leaf](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-leafpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) objects are used to specify the items in a display group. [Leaf](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-leafpyc.htm?ContextScope=all) objects are constructed as temporary objects, which are then used as arguments to [DisplayGroup](https://help.3ds.com/2022/english/DSSIMULIA_Established/SIMACAEKERRefMap/simaker-c-displaygrouppyc.htm?ContextScope=all) commands.
